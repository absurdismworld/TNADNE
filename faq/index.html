<h1>1. What is this?</h1>
<p>Thisnecoarcdoesnotexist or TNADNE is a project inspired by thispersondoesnotexist, TFDNE, artbreeder, thiscatdoesnotexist and many others using ai to generate anything from people to animals to drawn art to ungodly horror. This project uses <a href="https://twitter.com/ai_curio/status/1469192013484421120">"Looking Glass v1.1"</a> to generate endless Neco arcs and Neco arc bubbles. Training features both regular neco arc and neco arc bubbles, and the images are scraped from Google with manual checks to remove anything unsavory.</p>
<p><b>THIS PROJECT IS STRICTLY FOR FUN WITH NO INTENTION OF USE FOR PROFIT, MONETARY GAINS OR COMMERCIAL MEANS.</b></p>
  
<h1>2. Why is there only x amount of images available?</h1>
<p>We use Google Colab to generate a finite amount of images every few days, this is done to respect Google's usage limits. The image count will increase overtime.</p>
 
<h1>3. Why are the images so small?</h1>
<p>To prevent excess strain on the Colab servers and our partners storage devices images are generated in 256x256. For a closer look we recommend the built in browser zoom.

Due to the nature of the reconfiguring of images generated by Looking Glass, this service is not copyright friendly. Use of these generated images from copyrighted material can open you to litigation by the copyright holder(s).</p>
